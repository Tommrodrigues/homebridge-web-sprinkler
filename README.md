## Description

This [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin controls a web-based sprinkler system and exposes it to Apple's [HomeKit](http://www.apple.com/ios/home/). Using simple HTTP requests and the [Apixu API](https://www.apixu.com), the plugin schedules watering and allows you to monitor and turn on/off individual sprinkler zones.

Watering will be scheduled by the plugin to end just before the next sunrise, assuming that it will not rain in the next 2 days and that the temperature is not too low. If scheduled, watering will be adjusted according to the tempearture then divided up into a number of passes to prevent run-off. Only one zone will be activated at a time to maintain sufficient water pressure.

## Installation

1. Install [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation-details)

## API Interfacing

Your API should be able to:

```
{
    "zone": INT_VALUE,
    "zone": INT_VALUE,
    "zone": INT_VALUE,
    ...
}
```

2. Set zone state when it receives:
```
/zone/setState/INT_VALUE
```

### Optional (if listener is enabled)

1. Update `state` following a manual zone override by messaging the listen server:
```
/zone/state/INT_VALUE
```
