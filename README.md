## Description

This [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin controls a web-based sprinkler system and exposes it to Apple's [HomeKit](http://www.apple.com/ios/home/). Using simple HTTP requests and the [Apixu API](https://www.apixu.com), the plugin schedules watering and allows you to monitor and turn on/off individual sprinkler zones.

Both the watering staart time and the watering duration for each zone will be calculated by the plugin each day taking into account local weather conditions.

## Installation

1. Install [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation-details)
2. Install this plugin: `npm install -g homebridge-web-sprinklers`
3. Sign up to the [Apixu API](https://www.apixu.com)
4. Update your `config.json` file

## Configuration

| `lowThreshold` _(optional)_ | Temperature (°C) below which watering will be cancelled | `10` |
| `highThreshold` _(optional)_ | Temperature (°C) above which the default watering time will be increased by `heatMultiplier` | `20` |
| `heatMultiplier` _(optional)_ | Amount default watering time will be multiplied by if the max temperature is above `highThreshold`| `2` |
| `sunriseOffset` _(optional)_ | Minutes before sunset to finish schedule by | `60` |
| **(NEED TO IMPLEMENT)** `pollInterval` _(optional)_ | Time (in seconds) between device polls | `300` |

| `manufacturer` _(optional)_ | Appears under the _Manufacturer_ field for the accessory | author |
| `firmware` _(optional)_ | Appears under the _Firmware_ field for the accessory | version |

## API Interfacing

Your API should be able to:

1. **(NEED TO IMPLEMENT)** Return JSON information when it receives `/status` where `zone` is the zone number:
```
{
    "zone": INT_VALUE,
    "zone": INT_VALUE,
    "zone": INT_VALUE,
    ...
}
```

2. Set zone state when it receives:
```
/zone/setState/INT_VALUE
```

### Optional (if listener is enabled)

1. Update `state` following a manual zone override by messaging the listen server:
```
/zone/state/INT_VALUE
```

## Notes

- The recieving device should have an automatic shutoff feature where the valve will automatically close after a period of time (e.g. 30 minutes) just incase the shutoff message was not recieved due to a connection issue

- Watering needs vary widely as a result of a number of factors including sprinkler output, lawn type and local conditions. The plugin will schedule a watering cycle every day (assuming certain thresholds are not met) and may therefore be unsuitable if you need to limit watering to a certain number of days each week (unless you disable scheduling)

- By default, turning a valve on manually within the app will turn it off after the number of minutes you have defined for `defaultDuration`. You can change this manual duration from within the Home app for each zone. This will **not** affect the watering time calculated by the plugin for the schedule

- Your [Apixu API](https://www.apixu.com) key grants you access to `10000` API calls per month. This should not be a concern as the plugin will only make an API call once per day (as well as when homebridge starts up)
