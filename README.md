## Description

This [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin exposes a web-based sprinkler system to Apple's [HomeKit](http://www.apple.com/ios/home/). Using HTTP requests, the plugin allows you to turn on/off individual sprinkler zones. With the use of the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev), the plugin can also provide water scheduling.

Find script samples for the sprinkler controller in the _examples_ folder.

## Installation

1. Install [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation-details)
2. Install this plugin: `npm install -g homebridge-web-sprinklers`
3. Sign up (for free) to the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) and retrieve your API key (if you want scheduling)
4. Update your `config.json` file

## Scheduling

When scheduling is enabled, the plugin will ensure that watering finishes however many minutes before sunrise you specify in `sunriseOffset`. Therefore, the start time will vary daily as a result of changing sunrise times and may also be affected by individual zone watering times (see below).

E.g. If you have `2` zones and each zone will take `20` minutes to water, sunrise is at `07:40` and `sunriseOffset` is `60`, the watering start time will be: (`07:40` - `60`) - (`2` * `20`) = `05:00`

When adaptive watering is enabled, total zone watering time will be decided between a certain range. The difference will be calculated between the maximum forcasted temperature for that day and `minTemperature`, then it will be added to `defaultDuration`.

E.g. If `defaultDuration` is `10`, `minTemperature` is `10` and the maximum forecasted temperature is `25`, the total watering time per zone will be: `10` + (`25` - `10`) = `25` minutes

**Note:** If adaptive watering is disabled but scheduling remains active, each zone will be watered for the number of minutes specified in `defaultDuration`

## API Interfacing

Your API should be able to:

1. Return JSON information when it receives `/status`:
```
[
  {
    "zone": 1,
    "state": 0
  },
  {
    "zone": 2,
    "state": 0
  },
  {
    "zone": 3,
    "state": 0
  },
  ...
]
```

2. Set zone state when it receives:
```
/zone/setState/INT_VALUE
```

### Optional (if listener is enabled)

1. Update `state` following a manual zone override by messaging the listen server:
```
/zone/state/INT_VALUE
```

## Notes

- If you are using scheduling, the sprinkler controller should have an auto-shutoff feature where the valve will automatically close after a period of time (e.g. `30` minutes) has passed so that valves are not left open if there was an error recieving the off message from the plugin

- Your API key grants you access to `1000` API calls per day. The plugin will only make an API call once per day (as well as when homebridge starts up) so you do not need to worry about running out of API calls.

## To-do

- [ ] Ensure the main service is set to `In Use` when a valve is active

- [ ] Set `Program Mode` to manual when user manually overrides valve

- [ ] Update `Remaining Duration` accordingly - for main service or for each valve?
