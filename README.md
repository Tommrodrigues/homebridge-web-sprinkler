## Description

This [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin exposes a web-based sprinkler system to Apple's [HomeKit](http://www.apple.com/ios/home/). Using simple HTTP requests, the plugin allows you to turn on/off individual sprinkler zones. With the use of the [Apixu API](https://www.apixu.com), the plugin can also provide scheduling for your sprinkler system.

Both the watering start times and the watering durations can be (and are by default) calculated by the plugin each day, taking into account local weather conditions and user-specified values.

## Installation

1. Install [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation-details)
2. Install this plugin: `npm install -g homebridge-web-sprinklers`
3. Sign up to the [Apixu API](https://www.apixu.com) (if you want scheduling)
4. Update your `config.json` file

## Configuration

#### Accessory with scheduling

```json
"accessories": [
     {
       "accessory": "WebSprinklers",
       "name": "Sprinklers",
       "apiroute": "http://myurl.com",
       "town": "London",
       "country": "UK",
       "key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
       "zones": 8
     }
]
```

#### Accessory only

```json
"accessories": [
     {
       "accessory": "WebSprinklers",
       "name": "Sprinklers",
       "apiroute": "http://myurl.com",
       "enableSchedule": false
     }
]
```

| `name` | Name to appear in the Home app | N/A |
| `apiroute` | Root URL of your device | N/A |
| `town` | Your nearest town | N/A |
| `country` | Your country code | N/A |
| `key` | Your [Apixu API](https://www.apixu.com) key  | N/A |

## Optional fields
| Key | Description | Default |

| `rainThreshold` _(optional)_ | Rain threshold (in inches) at which watering will be cancelled | `0.05` |
| `lowThreshold` _(optional)_ | Temperature (°C) below which watering will be cancelled | `10` |
| `highThreshold` _(optional)_ | Temperature (°C) above which the default watering time will be increased by `heatMultiplier` | `20` |
| `heatMultiplier` _(optional)_ | Amount default watering time will be multiplied by if the max temperature is above `highThreshold`| `2` |
| `sunriseOffset` _(optional)_ | Minutes before sunset to finish schedule by | `60` |
| **(NEED TO IMPLEMENT)** `pollInterval` _(optional)_ | Time (in seconds) between device polls | `300` |

### Additional options
| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `manufacturer` _(optional)_ | Appears under the _Manufacturer_ field for the accessory | author |
| `firmware` _(optional)_ | Appears under the _Firmware_ field for the accessory | version |

## API Interfacing

Your API should be able to:

1. **(NEED TO IMPLEMENT)** Return JSON information when it receives `/status` where `zone` is the zone number:
```
{
    "zone": INT_VALUE,
    "zone": INT_VALUE,
    "zone": INT_VALUE,
    ...
}
```

2. Set zone state when it receives:
```
/zone/setState/INT_VALUE
```

### Optional (if listener is enabled)

1. Update `state` following a manual zone override by messaging the listen server:
```
/zone/state/INT_VALUE
```

## Notes

- The sprinkler controller should have an automatic shutoff feature where the valve will automatically close after a period of time (e.g. 30 minutes) so the valve is not left constantly open if there was an error recieving the turn off message

- Watering needs vary widely as a result of a number of factors including sprinkler output, lawn type and local conditions. The plugin will schedule a watering cycle every day (assuming certain thresholds are not met) and may therefore be unsuitable if you need to limit watering to a certain number of days each week (unless you disable scheduling)

- Turning a valve on manually within the app will not start a timer - you must manually disable the valve

- Your [Apixu API](https://www.apixu.com) key grants you access to `10000` API calls per month. This should not be a concern as the plugin will only make an API call once per day (as well as when homebridge starts up)
